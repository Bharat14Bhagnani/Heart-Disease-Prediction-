# Heart-Disease-Prediction-
This project uses a dataset from Kaggle to Predict Heart Disease. This model was tested on various algorithms like Decision tree, Random Forest, KNN, XG Boots. All the data sets and the important Pickle files of the algoriths that gave the highest accurate result, i.e lowest error rate are included.

1) If you are using command prompt to run the code, open the cmd in the folder where you have stored these files.
2) Type pip then press enter
3) Type pip install -r requirements.txt
4) After all the processes are complete, then type python app.py and then press enter
5) If that doesn't works, or if you encounter problems even after running this command, then pip install all the files that haven't installed. The name of all the libraries that weren't able to install.
6) Make sure to write full name of the libraries.
7) e.g. if sklearn isn't installed, then type pip install scikit-learn
8) Once all the libraries are installed, type python app.py
9) you will get an http url.
10) Copy that url and paste it in a browser.
